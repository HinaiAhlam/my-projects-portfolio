The .NET stack (or .NET technology stack) is a collection of Microsoft technologies used to build software applications. Think of it like a toolbox — everything you need to build an app is in there. It’s often used to build web apps, desktop apps, and mobile apps.

A “stack” usually has three layers:

Frontend (what users see)

Backend (the brain of the app)

Database (where data is stored)
