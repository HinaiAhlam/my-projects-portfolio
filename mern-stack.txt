The MERN stack is a popular full-stack JavaScript framework used for building modern web applications. “MERN” stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js—each representing a layer of the stack. Let’s break it down component by component.
Think of it like a restaurant system:

Frontend (React) – The menu and dining area

What the customer sees and interacts with (buttons, forms, pages).

Built using React.js.

Backend (Node + Express) – The kitchen and staff

Handles orders from the customer, cooks the food, and sends it back.

Built using Node.js (server) + Express.js (makes handling orders easy).

Database (MongoDB) – The pantry/storage

Stores all the ingredients (data like user info, posts, products).

Built using MongoDB (flexible and stores data in JSON-like format).
