MERN and Spring Boot are popular technologies for web application development. MERN is a full-stack JavaScript framework, while Spring Boot is a Java-based backend framework. Choosing between them depends on project requirements, team skills, and scalability needs.

Spring Boot is better suited for enterprise applications requiring robustness, security, and scalability.
